# gainsets
concept for choosing and maintaining sets of PID gains depending on input parameters.  this concept would facilitate boaters themselves to experiment with the settings without having to remember what setting was good for which circumstance.

to install:
 - put gainsets.py and gainsets.conf in openplotter's /home/pi/.openplotter/ directory
 - configure the 4 constants at the beginning of the file          
 - optional: make a menu item using Raspberry - Preferences - Main Menu Editor

to run:
 - as user pi, type 
      python gainsets.py
 - or use the menu item
